# Go for Chrome

This is a chrome extension which allows you to set up your own custom
keywords to redirect you to bookmarked URLs.

It differs from shortened URL services in that the links are memorable
to you personally, but has the downside that sharing short links is much
harder.

## Installation

Download from the Chrome Store and add to Chrome.

## Usage

Simply type "go [shortcut]" in the omnibar and if the shortcut doesn't
already exist, you'll be taken to a page where you can add it. From then
on the same command will take you directly to the page.
